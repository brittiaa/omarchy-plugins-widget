<!-- One widget per pull request, please. -->

## What it is

<!-- What does it show, and why does it earn space on someone's wallpaper? -->

## Screenshots

<!-- Every size you offer, on a dark theme and a light one. -->

| | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|
| `1×1` | | |
| `2×1` | | |

## Does it run or fetch anything?

<!-- Subprocesses, files read, network requests. "No" is a fine answer, and
     the most common one. If yes, say what and how often, here rather than in
     a footnote. -->

No.

## What you tested against

<!-- Missing data, stale data, no network, a value far longer than expected,
     a fresh config, an existing one. -->
